## Notes

- `username` is unique and immutable.
- Only registration endpoints work without auth.
- Deleting a trainee cascades deletion of their trainings.
- Activation is not idempotent.
- All endpoints require logging with a `transactionId`.
- Input should be validated; unified error handling required.
